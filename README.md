# stiction-rendering-in-touch
"Human perception of surface stickiness is closely related to intermittent slip dynamics, or stiction. In this work, we develop a method for real-time closed-loop rendering of surface stiction on an electroadhesive surface haptic display, and test it on a custom-built tribometer. We perform a psychophysical study to determine the effectiveness of a single, user-adjustable parameter on perceived surface stickiness, and elucidate what aspect of friction shapes the percept."
